Shorezone 3D Units notes
--------------------------------------------
Documentation suggests that the features displayed can be filtered based on camera extent simply by opening the layer in 'ONDEMAND' mode.

This code snippet was copied from some 3.2 ArcGIS JS code:

```
featureLayer = new FeatureLayer("https://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Petroleum/KSPetro/MapServer/1",
  {
    mode: FeatureLayer.MODE_ONDEMAND,
    infoTemplate: infoTemplate,
    outFields: ["*"]
  });
```

Look at FeatureLayerView. Apparently the features are not renderd by the feature layer, just queried. In order to get a list of features that are in view, you need to talk to the FeatureLayerView.
